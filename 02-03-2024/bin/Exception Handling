Exception Handling: The process of handling exceptions in java program, to maintain the 
==================  normal flow of java program execution.


=> In java Throwable is super class to the all Errors and Exceptions


Throwable:
   - Error: the errors are irrecoverable/not able to catch.
   - Exception: the exceptions are able recover/able to catch.
   
=> Types of Exceptions in Java,
			- Predefined exceptions:
					- Checked Exceptions: Exception and all its sub-classes(except RuntimeException and all its sub-classes) are called checked exceptions.
					- Unchecked Exceptions: RuntimeException and all its sub-classes are called unchecked exceptions.
					
			- User defined exceptions:

To implement exception handling in Java, we use following blocks and keywords:

blocks:

1. try: problematic part statements we have place here.
2. catch: handler part statements we have place here.
3. finally: cleanup/resource release or compulsory statements need to executed, we have to place here.

Exception Handling Scenarios:

*1. try-catch
2. try-catch-catch
*3. try-catch-finally
4. try-finally
5. nested try-catch

keywords:
 
1. throws: we use throws keyword to declare the exception classes with method signature/head part.
2. throw: to define/create exception objects in method body, we use throw keyword.

User defined exceptions: the exceptions which are created based predefined exceptions, for our business need.
